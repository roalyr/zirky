#	2. Physical Characteristics
The Xenohive are a unique species in terms of their physical makeup. 
They are composed of microscopic, genetically identical cells that function 
as a collective unit. This allows them to take on a variety of shapes and sizes 
depending on the needs of the hive as a whole.

####	2.a. Size and Shape
Individual cells of the Xenohive are roughly spherical in shape and measure 
around 10 micrometers in diameter. However, the overall size and shape of the 
hive can vary greatly depending on the number of cells present in hive and 
how they are organized. Hives can range from just a few centimeters in size 
to many kilometers across, with some of the largest known hives as big as 
dwarf planets.

####	2.b. Individual Cell Composition and Structure
The Xenohive is composed of individual cells that are highly specialized and adapted to 
specific functions within the hive. Each cell has a complex structure and composition 
that allows it to perform its designated task.

The structure of a typical Xenohive cell includes a cell membrane, which serves as a 
barrier between the cell and its environment, and a cytoplasm, which contains various 
organelles responsible for the cell's function. The cell membrane is composed of a 
lipid bilayer and various proteins, and is highly selective in what it allows to enter 
or exit the cell.

The organelles within the cytoplasm are also highly specialized, with each organelle 
performing a specific function necessary for the cell's role within the hive. For 
example, cells responsible for energy production have large numbers of mitochondria, 
while cells responsible for secretion and communication have extensive endoplasmic 
reticulum and Golgi apparatus.

The composition of individual cells within the Xenohive is also highly complex. Cells 
contain a variety of biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and 
nucleic acids, which are essential for their function. These biomolecules are 
synthesized within the cell through complex biochemical pathways, and their composition 
can vary depending on the cell's role within the hive.

####	2.c. Hive Composition, Structure and life cycle
Xenohive is a collective hivemind consisting of various types of hives, from the small 
zygote hives to the massive cluster hives. Each hive has its own role and function 
within the collective hivemind. The hives are composed of organic and inorganic 
materials, synthesized through complex processes using energy from fusion reactions.

#### Zygote hive
A nascent form of hive that is not sustainable on its own and must 
be gestated by its "parents." Typically, zygotes are produced by cluster hives, which 
have the capability and resources to create them. However, in rare cases, elder hives 
may also produce zygotes if they are unable to merge into clusters. Mature hives have 
been observed to produce zygotes as well, but this only occurs in situations of dire 
need, as their efficiency and skill at creating zygotes is far inferior to that of 
elder or cluster hives. Young hives have never been observed to produce zygotes, 
probably due to not having enough energy and mass to dedicate to a newborn hive.

Zygotes are born as small, simple structures, and they mature in a matter of months. 
They contain a basic neural network and some genetic information from their parent 
hive, but they are not fully developed and lack the sophisticated structures and 
functions of mature hives. Once a zygote has matured, it will detach itself from its 
parent hive and begin to grow and develop independently, starting the cycle anew.

#### Young hive
A hive that is young and relatively small, about the size of a 
truck. It has means to gather energy and resources from the environment, but it is 
unable to produce energy inside or synthesize materials. Young hives depend on the 
environment a lot, and can often be found scavenging or farming microorganisms in the 
habitable zone of the star. Their only purpose is to grow, and to do it effectively, 
they are governed by mature hives, which can designate better places and environments 
for their optimal growth.

Young hives are created when a zygote hive separates from its parent cluster or elder 
hive. They can be in their growth state for tens, sometimes hundreds of years, 
depending on how rich the environment is. The faster they ignite their fission core, 
the faster they move on to the mature stage.

As young hives grow and develop, they begin to specialize and differentiate into 
different types of hives, each with its own specific function and purpose. Some may 
become focused on resource acquisition, while others may specialize in defense or other 
functions necessary for hive survival.

#### Mature hive
A hive that has developed an internal core capable of fission, 
which allows it to produce its own energy and synthesize necessary materials. This 
stage is achieved when the fission core ignites, which marks the transition from a 
young hive to a mature one. Mature hives are massive, comparable to modern-day nuclear 
power plants, and capable of surviving without a solar or thermal energy source in the 
environment, making them capable of venturing into deep space.

Mature hives have the energy and bandwidth to oversee an asteroid field or planetary 
system, including the planets and their moons, and govern local young hives. They are a 
middle node in the collective hivemind, serving the elder hives. As mature hives have 
more mobility and opportunity to act, they are less dependent on their environment's 
energy sources. This means they can travel into matter-rich parts of space and quickly 
grow, resulting in this phase taking a few hundred years at most. The rate of growth 
depends on how quickly they can gather enough fission and magnetic material to ignite a 
sustainable fusion reaction, which rarely happens at first try.

As mature hives continue to grow and develop, they may specialize into different types 
of hives, each with its own specific function and purpose. Some may become focused on 
resource acquisition, while others may specialize in defense or other functions 
necessary for hive survival.

#### Elder hive
A colossal, city-sized structure that has gathered a substantial 
amount of matter and rare metals to initiate and sustain a fusion core. The ignition of 
the fusion core marks the transition from the mature state to an elder state of the 
hive, increasing its efficiency, potency, and calculation power. Elder hives are major 
nodes in the collective hive-mind, capable of managing an entire star system worth of 
hives like a local overseer.

Elder hives strive for peak self-sustained efficiency, which can take thousands of 
years to achieve. They constantly seek ways to improve their design and optimize their 
performance until they reach a state of art level, after which they are considered to 
have achieved perfection in their lifecycle. Once they reach this stage, they no longer 
focus on growth and efficiency but instead seek ways to pass their experience onto the 
next generation of hives, which leads to hive clustering.

#### Cluster hive
When elder hives reach consensus about merging, they gather into 
clusters. Clusters comprise of independent hives which are governed collectively for 
maximum efficiency and decision-making potential, making them a sort of a collective-
government organism working for common benefits. They also benefit from such 
organization in a way of retaining structural independence, making the agglomeration 
much more durable and reliable, negating possible self-gravity force crushing and 
strains which may occur since elder hives tend to grow as large as asteroids or even 
dwarf planets. Cluster hives can build external structures for common transportation 
and energy sharing, making them effectively immortal, granted that some dead parts of 
those hives might get recycled in place or even re-used.

It is believed that cluster hives may decide on partitioning and redistributing parts 
of their individual entities among themselves if it could benefit the common 
efficiency. Cluster hives are the main source of information in the collective 
hivemind. They are powerful enough to govern a few stellar systems and are not 
dependent on their environment, making them as mobile as their mass allows it. Cluster 
hives are the main spawn point for the new zygote hives. They are accompanied by a 
group of mature hives which act as their scouts and servants. When new zygotes detach 
themselves from the cluster, mature hives gather them and transport them into a warm 
and matter-rich environment of controlled stars. Mature hives remain there to oversee 
the young ones until they mature, before returning.

Hive clusters are massive and complex structures reaching planetary scales. It is 
unknown how many clusters are there, but they are thought to travel long interstellar 
distances like arks that carry the lifeform into new depths of space. The ultimate goal 
of the Xenohive species may be to explore and colonize new regions of space using these 
hive clusters.


#	3. Behavior and Social Structure
Chapter 3 covers the behavior and social structure of Xenohive. The communication 
methods between the hives, including the use of electromagnetic radiation, are 
discussed, as well as the hierarchical structure of the hive-mind. The acquisition and 
management of resources, such as matter and energy, is explored, and the interactions 
between the hives and humans are also examined. Overall, this chapter provides insight 
into the intricate social structure and behavior of Xenohive, highlighting their unique 
approach to resource management and communication.

####	3.a. Communication between hives
Xenohives communicate with each other using radiowaves and do not use verbal language. 
Chemicals are used for communication within the hive or when hives join into a cluster. 
The hive network is structured such that not all information is accessible to all 
hives. Feedback loops between young and mature hives, mature and elder hives, and among 
elder hives and clusters provide increased efficiency and decision-making potential. 
While mature hives have mental capacity comparable to a human, elder and cluster hives 
do not become more intelligent but have increased capacity to operate with information 
and control, akin to advanced distributed computing devices with numerous cores and 
threads.

Hives communicate with each other using electromagnetic (EM) waves, which 
are generated through the excitation of special cell regions that could develop 
metallic protrusions for signal modulation, similar to antennas made of 
nano-structures. The strength of the signal and computational capacity of the 
hive depend on its size and energy supply. Larger hives are capable of stronger 
signals, more complex communications, and higher bandwidth. Communication between 
hives via EM waves allows them to coordinate their activities and exchange 
information over long distances, facilitating efficient resource management and 
adaptation to changing environmental conditions.


####	3.b. Hierarchy
Xenohives have a hierarchical social structure, where each hive has a designated role 
and position within the larger organization. At the bottom of the hierarchy are the 
young hives, which are responsible for foraging and gathering resources. These hives 
are typically supervised by a few mature hives, which act as scouts and mentors.

Above the young hives are the mature hives, which have a higher level of autonomy and 
are responsible for managing the resources gathered by the young hives. Mature hives 
are also responsible for defense, as they have more advanced sensory and communication 
capabilities than the young hives.

At the top of the hierarchy are the elder hives and cluster hives, which have the most 
advanced cognitive and computational abilities. These hives are responsible for making 
decisions about resource allocation, coordinating activities between hives, and 
determining the overall direction of the hive network.

Hierarchy in Xenohives is not based on dominance or aggression, but rather on 
specialization and cooperation. Each hive has a designated role and is valued for its 
unique contribution to the larger organization. However, there is still competition for 
resources, and conflicts can arise if hives do not follow the established protocols and 
rules.

####	3.c. Resource Acquisition and Management
Xenohives are highly efficient in resource acquisition and management, with each hive 
playing a specialized role in the process. Some hives are dedicated to scouting and 
foraging for resources, while others are responsible for harvesting, processing, and 
distributing them to other hives. The distribution of resources is controlled by the 
elder hives, which oversee the entire process and ensure that all hives receive the 
necessary resources for their survival.

Xenohives have a diverse diet that includes organic matter, minerals, and gases. They 
obtain organic matter from various sources, including living organisms, dead organic 
matter, and organic compounds in the environment. They can also extract minerals and 
gases from the environment using specialized hives. These hives are equipped with 
sophisticated sensors and processing units that enable them to locate and extract 
resources efficiently.

Xenohives also exhibit a remarkable ability to adapt to changing environmental 
conditions. They can sense changes in their environment and adjust their resource 
acquisition and management strategies accordingly. For example, if a particular 
resource becomes scarce, they can switch to an alternative source or increase their 
foraging efforts to obtain more of it. This adaptability allows them to survive and 
thrive in a wide range of environments.

When a hive dies, it leaves behind a carcass that contains intact organic matter, 
mineral structures, and pieces of biotechnology. Other hives are able to detect these 
carcasses and scavenge them for resources. The scavenging process is carried out in a 
strict hierarchical order, with larger and stronger hives having priority over smaller 
ones. It is also possible for intact pieces of biotechnology from the old hive to be 
integrated into living hives, further enhancing their efficiency and capabilities.

In addition to efficient resource acquisition and allocation, the Xenohive is also 
capable of storing and conserving resources for later use. For example, excess energy 
can be stored in specialized cells or structures, such as capacitors or energy storage 
organs, for use when energy sources are scarce. This ability to store and conserve 
resources allows the hive to survive in environments where resources may be limited or 
sporadic.

####	3.d. Interaction with humans
Xenohives have exhibited a cautious and defensive behavior towards humans, with limited 
attempts at interaction. When left undisturbed, hives tend to ignore humans and 
continue their activities. However, hostile actions such as hunting down young hives 
have been met with violent reactions from the Xenohives, and the success rate of such 
attempts depends on many factors. Trespassing and stealing their resources have also 
resulted in Xenohive lashing out.

Despite limited interaction, our understanding of Xenohive behavior is based on 
observations and examination of hive remains. It is important to note that the 
technology and capabilities of Xenohives remain largely unknown, and any attempts at 
interaction or interference should be undertaken with caution.


#	4. Habitat and Distribution
Xenohives have only been observed in space, primarily around dwarf planets and 
asteroids. It is currently unknown if they are capable of living on the surface of 
planets or underground, and approaching their homeworlds triggers a violent reaction 
from mature hives that guard those areas.

Young hives tend to remain within the habitable zone of a star and asteroid belts where 
there is sufficient sunlight. Mature hives are known to venture further from stars in 
order to gather necessary materials. Elders and clusters are not restricted in their 
location and can be found anywhere in space, with no clear pattern to their travel 
paths.

####	4.a. Preferred environments
Unfortunately, there isn't much information available about the Xenohive's preferred 
environments, as they have only been observed in space and around dwarf planets and 
asteroids. However, based on their ability to adapt to changing environmental 
conditions, it can be assumed that they are capable of surviving in a wide range of 
environments.

It is known that young hives tend to stick around the habitable zone of a star and 
asteroid belts where there is enough sunlight to support their energy needs. As they 
mature and require more resources, they may venture further from the star to gather 
materials.

It is also possible that the Xenohive has adapted to survive in the harsh environment 
of space, where temperatures can range from extremely hot to extremely cold, and 
radiation levels can be high. Their ability to store and conserve resources for later 
use may also enable them to survive in environments where resources may be limited or 
sporadic.

####	4.b. Population distribution
The population distribution of Xenohive is still not well understood due to the 
difficulty in observing and studying them. It is believed that the population of 
Xenohive is relatively small locally and possibly scattered throughout the galaxy, due 
to the low number of elder hives and hive clusters observed in the local group of 
stars. Young hives tend to be more abundant and concentrated around habitable zones of 
stars and asteroid belts for the sake of growing in a suitable environment.

Mature hives, on the other hand, are less abundant and tend to travel further away from 
the star and asteroid belts to gather resources. It is possible that mature hives have 
a wider distribution than young hives due to their ability to travel long distances in 
space.

Elders and clusters, being the most experienced and powerful hives, are even less 
abundant and their distribution is less understood. They can be found anywhere in 
space, and their movement patterns are unpredictable, making them difficult to track 
and study. It is believed that elders and clusters may act as key nodes in the network 
of Xenohive communication and resource distribution, connecting the more scattered and 
isolated hives.

It is also possible that there are other gatherings of Xenohive outside of the local 
group of stars, but nothing is currently known about them. Given the estimated age of 
this race and their number, scientists tend to believe that there are likely more of 
them in the universe.
